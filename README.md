# IMD Postcode Checker

The IMD Postcode Checker is a tiny thing made with lean but boring code,
open data and plenty of ❤️.

The tool enables you to look up the Index of Multiple Deprivation rank for a
list of postcodes. The lower the rank, the more deprived the area.

The results can be limited to a maximum decile value. A decile is a range
divided into 10 chunks similar to the way a percentage is a range divided into
100 chunks. A decile of 1 means the postcode is in the bottom 10% of of the
deprivation index, a decile of 2 means the postcode is in the bottom 20%, and so
on.

## What is the IMD?

The Index of Multiple Deprivation, commonly known as the IMD, is the official
measure of relative deprivation for small areas in England.

The Index of Multiple Deprivation ranks every small area, called lower-layer
super output areas (LSOA), in England from 1 (most deprived area) to 32,844
(least deprived area).

The IMD combines information from the seven domains to produce an overall
relative measure of deprivation. The domains are combined using the following
weights:

- Income Deprivation (22.5%)
- Employment Deprivation (22.5%)
- Education, Skills and Training Deprivation (13.5%)
- Health Deprivation and Disability (13.5%)
- Crime (9.3%)
- Barriers to Housing and Services (9.3%)
- Living Environment Deprivation (9.3%)

## Installing for local development

This project is a dead simple single file PHP script plus a SQLite database. The database is rather large, so I distribute it as in a compressed 7zip file.

1. Clone or download the code
2. Extract the SQLite database file found in `db\imd.sqlite3.7z`. The `imd.sqlite3` file should be placed in the `db` folder.
3. Start a local PHP server in the root directory of the project: ` php -S localhost:8000`
4. Visit `http://localhost:8000`

Note: you might need to [install PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) locally first. If you get errors, check your `php.ini` file and make sure `extension=pdo_sqlite` is enabled.

## Technical notes

The tool is a single PHP file, a stylesheet and a SQLite database containing
some stripped-back ONSPD and IMD data. Specifically, we're using only the
following columns from those data sets:

    onspd.pcds
    imd.lsoa_name_11
    imd.imd_rank
    imd.imd_decile
